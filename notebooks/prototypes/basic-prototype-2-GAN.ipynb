    "\n",
    "Builds on Basic Prototype 1, adds yolov8 pose detection. Landmarks will be saved in a datastructure which then will be visualised and probably exported as a JSON so that it can be trained on Google Colab. This prototype focuses on testing if an AI model can be trained to interpolate and output the correct landmarks to continue the video sequence after being trained on the sequences of the videos.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pose detection wise, Openpose is better since it has more landmarks and also tracks the foot, it is also based on C++ so it's quicker, but I cannot get openpose to work yet, so I will implement using YOLOv8 for now just to test the AI model structure. \n",
    "\n",
    "Mediapipe is also a possibility but it can only detect 1 person at a time and is much slower. \n",

    "Still the broadcast on OBS has to be started manually first."
